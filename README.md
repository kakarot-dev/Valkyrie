# Valkyrie

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://harmony-cdn.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/logo.png">
</p>

A [Discord](https://discord.com) clone using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/).

[Live Demo](https://valkyrieapp.xyz)

**Notes:**

- File Upload is disabled.
- The design does not fully match current Discord anymore.
- Data regularly gets wiped, so you can use any valid email and password.
- For the old [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) stack using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) check out the [v1](https://github.com/kakarot-dev/restila/tree/v1) branch.

## Installation

### Server

If you are familiar with `make`, take a look at the `Makefile` to quickly setup the following steps
or alternatively copy the commands into your CLI.

1. Install Docker and get the Postgresql and Redis containers (`make postgres` && `make redis`)
2. Start both containers (`make start`) and create a DB (`make createdb`)
3. Install Golang and get all the dependencies (`go mod tidy`)
4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values

- `Required`

        PORT=4000
        DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/valkyrie
        REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
        CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
        SECRET=SUPERSECRET
        HANDLER_TIMEOUT=5
        MAX_BODY_BYTES=4194304 # 4MB in Bytes = 4 * 1024 * 1024

- `Optional: Not needed to run the app, but you won't be able to upload files or send emails.`

        AWS_ACCESS_KEY=ACCESS_KEY
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
        AWS_S3_REGION=S3_REGION
        GMAIL_USER=GMAIL_USER
        GMAIL_PASSWORD=GMAIL_PASSWORD

5. Run `go run github.com/kakarot-dev/restila` to run the server

**Alternatively**: If you only want to run the backend without installing Golang and all dependencies, you can download the pre compiled server from the [Release tab](https://github.com/kakarot-dev/restila/releases) instead. You will still need to follow the above steps 1, 2 and 4.

### Web

1. Install the latest or LTS version of Node.
2. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies
3. Run `yarn start` to start the client
4. Go to `localhost:3000`

## Endpoints

Once the server is running go to `localhost:<PORT>/swagger/index.html` to see all the HTTP endpoints
and `localhost:<PORT>` for all the websockets events.

## Tests

All tests are run on all push and pull requests. Only if they are successful it will run the other Github Actions to automatically deploy the updates.

### Server

All routes in `handler` have tests written for them.

Function calls in the `service` directory that do not just delegate work to the repository have tests written for them.

Run `go test -v -cover ./service/... ./handler/...` (`make test`) to run all tests

Additionally this repository includes E2E tests for all successful requests. To run them you
have to have Postgres and Redis running in Docker and then run `go test github.com/kakarot-dev/restila` (`make e2e`).

### Web

Most `useQuery` hooks have tests written for them.

To run them use `yarn test`.

Additionally [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is used for E2E testing.

To run them you need to have the server and the client running.
After that run `yarn cypress` to open the test window.

**Note**: For unkown reasons websockets connection only randomly work during Cypress runs, which makes testing them impossible.
